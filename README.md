# arduino_usb_suspend_resume
This is code for an Arduino Pro Micro that can suspend/sleep or resume a PC connected via USB as it monitors when an input pin is grounded or not.

Ensure that your USB port will continue to provide power while it is in suspended/sleep mode.  This is usually the case as USB keyboards can be used to wake a sleeping PC.
